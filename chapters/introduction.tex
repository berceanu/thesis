\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminary}

\subsection{Linear response theory}
\label{subsec:linear-response}

Let $\phi_0(\rv)$ be the steady state solution to the
GP equation in the time-independent trapping potential $U_0(\rv)$
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GP-atoms}
  H_{\text{GP}} \phi_0 = 0
\end{equation}
% 
with the GP Hamiltonian defined as\footnote{This section follows
  loosely the formalism presented in Ref.~\cite{9783540410478}.}
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GP-ham}
  H_{\text{GP}} \equiv -\frac{\nabla^2}{2m} + U_0 + gN_0\abs{\phi_0}^2 - \mu
\end{equation}
% 

This Hamiltonian describes a bosonic condensate of $N_0$ particles with
contact interactions quantified by $g$, and chemical potential $\mu$.

Now consider adding a small time-dependent perturbation on top of the
trap, giving $U(\rv,t)=U_0(\rv) + \delta U(\rv,t)$. We are interested
in the response of the condensate to this perturbation.  For weak
perturbations, we can perform a linearization of the GP equation
Eq.~\eqref{eq:GP-atoms} around the stationary solution $\phi_0$. This
approach is known in the literature as the ``linear response''
formalism.

The condensate wavefunction $\phi(\rv,t)$ evolves according to
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GP-atoms-evolution}
  i\partial_t \phi = \left[-\frac{\nabla^2}{2m} + U + gN_0 \abs{\phi}^2 - \mu\right] \phi
\end{equation}
% 
We assume a small deviation of the wavefunction from its initial
steady state
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ansatz-atoms}
  \phi(\rv,t) = \phi_0(\rv) + \delta\phi(\rv,t)
\end{equation}
% 
such that we can expand Eq.~\eqref{eq:GP-atoms-evolution} and keep only linear terms in $\delta\phi$ and $\delta U$. We get
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GP-atoms-lin}
  i\partial_t\delta\phi =  \left[-\frac{\nabla^2}{2m} + U_0-\mu\right]
  \delta\phi + 2 g N_0 \phi_0^{\star}\phi_0\delta\phi + gN_0\phi_0^2\delta\phi^{\star}
  +\delta U\phi_0
\end{equation}
% 
Note that Eq.~\eqref{eq:GP-atoms-lin} is not strictly linear due to
the coupling of $\delta\phi$ to $\delta\phi^{\star}$. To restore
linearity, we consider the functions $\delta\phi$ and
$\delta\phi^{\star}$ as being independent and write the linear system
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GP-atoms-system}
  i \partial_t \colvec{\delta\phi(\rv,t)}{\delta\phi^{\star}(\rv,t)}
  = \Lca_{GP} \colvec{\delta\phi(\rv,t)}{\delta\phi^{\star}(\rv,t)}
  + \colvec{S(\rv,t)}{-S^{\star}(\rv,t)}
\end{equation}
% 
where we have introduced the linear operator
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:LGP}
  \Lca_{\text{GP}} = \mat{H_{\text{GP}}+gN_0\abs{\phi_0}^2}{g N_0 \phi_0^2}{-g N_0 \phi_0^{\star 2}}{-\left[H_{\text{GP}}+gN_0\abs{\phi_0}^2\right]^{\star}}
\end{equation}
% 
and the source term $S(\rv,t)=\delta U(\rv,t)\phi_0(\rv)$.  Note that
$\Lca_{\text{GP}}$ is not a Hermitian operator! The presence of the minus
sign in the second line is due to the fact that the particles obey
Bose statistics, as this is not present in the BCS theory.

The standard method of determining the time evolution of $\delta\phi$
is to expand it in the basis formed by the eigenvectors of
$\Lca_{\text{GP}}$.

There is a subtlety involved here, however, as in the general case
$\Lca_{\text{GP}}$ is not diagonalizable. It usually has too few
eigenvectors to span the whole functional space\footnote{We are
  referring to the $L^2 \times L^2$ space, with $L^2$ being the space
  of square-integrable complex functions.}.

The solution to this problem, detailed in Ref.~\cite{Castin_1998},
is to work in the subspace orthogonal to $\ket{\phi_0}$. It can be
shown that the component of the solution along $\ket{\phi_0}$ only
results in a change of phase of the total condensate wavefunction. For
the problems of interest in the rest of this manuscript, however, the
dimension of the space parallel to $\ket{\phi_0}$ that we must project
out is of order 1.

We now consider the eigenvalue equation for the operator $\Lca_{\text{GP}}$
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:L-eigen}
  \Lca_{\text{GP}} \ket{\psi_k^R} = \epsilon_k \ket{\psi_k^R}
\end{equation}
% 
with $\ket{\psi_k^R}$ being the right eigenvector and $\epsilon_k$ its
corresponding eigenvalue
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:psi-R}
  \ket{\psi_k^R} = \colvec{\ket{u_k}}{\ket{v_k}}
\end{equation}
% 
Similarly, we also introduce the left eigenvector, obeying
$\Lca_{\text{GP}}^{\dagger} \ket{\psi_k^L} = \epsilon_k^{\star} \ket{\psi_k^L}$,
and the orthonormality condition
$\braket{\psi_k^L}{\psi_q^R} = \delta_{k,q}$. 

Notice that $\Lca_{\text{GP}}$ and $\Lca_{\text{GP}}^{\dagger}$ are
connected by the unitary transformation\footnote{Note that this holds
  as long as the Hamiltonian $H_{\text{GP}}$ only contains real
  terms.}
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:symmetry-1}
  \eta \Lca_{\text{GP}} \eta^{\dagger} = \Lca_{\text{GP}}^{\dagger}
\end{equation}
% 
where $\eta = \sigma_3 = \mat{1}{0}{0}{-1}$ is the third Pauli
matrix. We say that $\Lca_{\text{GP}}$ is $\eta$-Hermitian, meaning
that one can define a new scalar product
$\braket{\cdot}{\cdot}_{\eta} \equiv \braket{\cdot}{\eta \cdot}$ with a
different signature, such that
$\braket{\cdot}{\Lca_{\text{GP}} \cdot}_{\eta} =
\braket{\Lca_{\text{GP}} \cdot}{\cdot}_{\eta}$. The operator $\eta$ is
usually called the metric operator, and, not suprisingly in our case,
it is the same as the one of the scalar Klein-Gordon equation. A
pseudo-Hermitian operator usually also posesses antilinear symmetries,
and as we will see below this is also the case for
$\Lca_{\text{GP}}$. Interestingly, for operators with a real spectrum,
it can be shown that one can define another metric $\eta_+$, which
guarantees a positive-definite inner product, or, in other words,
$\braket{\psi}{\psi}_{\eta_+} > 0$ (provided $\psi \neq 0$ of
course). This can be used to formulate a probabilistic quantum theory
for the new wave-functions $\psi^R$ and $\psi^L$. For the general
theory and properties of pseudo-Hermitian operators, we point the
interested reader to Ref.~\cite{MOSTAFAZADEH_2010}.


Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:symmetry-1}, we get the general form of the left
eigen-vectors as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:psi-L}
  \bra{\psi_k^L} = {\cal N}_k \left( \bra{u_k},\, -\bra{v_k} \right)
\end{equation}
% 
with ${\cal N}_k$ a normalization factor.  We can chose
${\cal N}_k = \pm 1$ and group the eigenvalues of $\Lca_{\text{GP}}$
into 3 families, according to the quantity
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:norms}
  n_k = \braket{u_k}{u_k} - \braket{v_k}{v_k}
\end{equation}
% 
We therefore have: the ``$+$'' family, corresponding to $n_k=+1$, the
``$-$'' family, such that $n_k=-1$ and the ``$0$'' family, with
$n_k=0$.

% In the absence of the added weak perturbation, the time evolution of
% mode $k$ is given by $\exp(-i\epsilon_k t)$, from which we get the
% dynamical stability condition $\imag{(\epsilon_k)} \leq 0$ for all
% $k$. Dynamical stability is important because it insures that small
% perturbations will not induce the condensate wavefunction to evolve
% far from its steady state value.

We are now ready to write the completeness relation
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:completeness}
  \sum_k \ket{\psi_k^R} \bra{\psi_k^L} = \mathbb{I}
\end{equation}
% 
Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:completeness}, we can decompose any column vector
as\footnote{The modes in the ``$0$'' family do not appear in this
  expansion as their components live in the space orthogonal to the one
  of our solution.}
%
\begin{multline}\label{eq:decomposition}
  \colvec{\ket{l_1}}{\ket{l_2}} = \sum_{k \in ``+" \mbox{\scriptsize family}} \left[\braket{u_k}{l_1} - \braket{v_k}{l_2}\right]\colvec{\ket{u_k}}{\ket{v_k}}\\
  + \sum_{k \in ``-" \mbox{\scriptsize family}} \left[\braket{v_k}{l_2} - \braket{u_k}{l_1}\right]\colvec{\ket{u_k}}{\ket{v_k}}
\end{multline}
% 
There is now a further symmetry of $\Lca_{\text{GP}}$ that we can
exploit in our problem, a sort of time-reversal ``spin''-flip (or
particle-hole) symmetry, namely
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:symmetry-2}
   \Theta \Lca_{\text{GP}} \Theta^{\dagger} = -\Lca_{\text{GP}}
\end{equation}
%
where $\Theta = \sigma_1 \cal{K}$, with $\sigma_1 = \mat{0}{1}{1}{0}$
the first Pauli matrix and $\cal{K}$ the complex conjugation
antilinear operator.

This results in a duality between the ``$+$'' family with eigenvectors
$(u_k, v_k)$ and energy $\epsilon_k$ and the ``$-$'' family with
eigenvectors $(v_{-k}^{\star}, u_{-k}^{\star})$ and energy
$-\epsilon_{-k}^{\star}$.

We can now finally project Eq.~\eqref{eq:GP-atoms-system} onto the
eigenvectors of $\Lca_{\text{GP}}$. Using the above-mentioned duality and
Eq.~\eqref{eq:decomposition}, we get
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:phi-column-expansion}
  \colvec{\delta\phi(\rv,t)}{\delta\phi^{\star}(\rv,t)} = \sum_{k \in ``+" \mbox{\scriptsize family}}
  b_k(t) \colvec{u_k(\rv)}{v_k(\rv)}
  + b_{-k}^{\star}(t) \colvec{v_{-k}^{\star}(\rv)}{u_{-k}^{\star}(\rv)}
\end{equation}
% 
with the complex amplitudes $b_k$ satisfying 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:amplitudes-bk}
  i \frac{d}{dt}b_k(t) = \epsilon_k b_k(t) + s_k(t)
\end{equation}
% 
where we introduced
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:amplitudes-sk}
  s_k(t) = \left( \bra{u_k} ,\, -\bra{v_k} \right) \colvec{\ket{S(t)}}{-\ket{S^{\star}(t)}}
\end{equation}
% 

\subsection{Cherenkov emission}
\label{subsec:cherenkov}

We now turn to applying the formalism developed in
Sec.~\ref{subsec:linear-response} to a concrete physical example,
inspired by Ref.~\cite{Carusotto_2006}. Consider a 2-dimensional
Bose-Einstein atomic condensate in a state with well-defined momentum,
described by the plane wave
$\psi_0 \exp \left( i \bm{k_0} \rv - \omega_0 t \right)$. Using our
previous notation, this corresponds to
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:atom-initial}
  \phi_0(\rv) = \psi_0 \exp \left( i \bm{k_0} \rv \right)
\end{equation}
% 
and a chemical potential $\mu = \omega_0$. Since we have no trap,
$U_0(\rv)=0$, and Eq.~\eqref{eq:GP-atoms} reduces to
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:atom-MF}
  \omega_0 - \left( \frac{k_0^2}{2m} + g \rho_0 \right) = 0
\end{equation}
% 
where we have introduced the condensate density
$\rho_0 \equiv N_0 \abs{\psi_0}^2$.  

We now intoduce a weak perturbation in the form of a localized defect
potential $\delta U(\rv, t) = V_d(\rv)$, which can represent for
instance a laser spot depleting a small area of the condensate.

Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:atom-MF}, the GP Hamiltonian becomes
$H_{\text{GP}} = -\frac{\nabla^2}{2m} - \frac{k_0^2}{2m}$ and the
source term
$S(\rv) = \psi_0 V_d(\rv) \exp \left( i \bm{k_0} \rv \right)$. We now
get the linear operator for our problem in the form
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ourL}
  \Lca = \mat{-\frac{\nabla^2}{2m} - \frac{k_0^2}{2m} + g\rho_0}{g N_0 \psi_0^2 \exp \left( 2 i \bm{k_0} \rv \right)}{- g N_0 \psi_0^{\star 2} \exp \left( - 2 i \bm{k_0} \rv \right)}{-\left[ -\frac{\nabla^2}{2m} - \frac{k_0^2}{2m} + g\rho_0 \right]}
\end{equation}
% 
Notice that, due to the presence of the off-diagonal exponential
terms, $\Lca$ does not commute with the momentum operator, which is
the generator of the spatial translation group. Luckily, however, we
can restore translational invariance by a simple unitary
transformation, as shown below.

First, a brief reminder of basic quantum mechanics. Using the standard
commutation relations, one can show that, for a constant wavevector
$\bm{k_0}$, the unitary operator\footnote{The hat symbol denotes
  operators in the relevant Hilbert space.}
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:trans-oper}
  \hat{T}(\bm{k_0}) = \exp \left( -i \bm{k_0} \hat{\rv} \right)
\end{equation}
% 
performs a translation in momentum space,
$\hat{T}(\bm{k_0}) \ket{\bm{k}} = \ket{\bm{k} - \bm{k_0}}$, with the
ket $\ket{\bm{k}}$ representing a single particle state with
wavevector $\bm{k}$ such that
$\hat{\bm{k}} \ket{\bm{k}} = \bm{k} \ket{\bm{k}}$. Using the
definitions above, one can easily obtain the commutator
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:trans-commutator}
  \left[ \hat{\bm{k}},\, \hat{T}(\bm{k_0}) \right] = -\bm{k_0}\hat{T}(\bm{k_0}) 
\end{equation}
% 
This allows us to rewrite the following expressions
\begin{align}\label{eq:products}
  \begin{split}
    \hat{T}^{\dagger}(\bm{k_0})\hat{\bm{k}}\hat{T}(\bm{k_0})& = \hat{\bm{k}} - \bm{k_0}\hat{\mathbb{I}}\\
    \hat{T}(\bm{k_0})\hat{\bm{k}}\hat{T}^{\dagger}(\bm{k_0})& = \hat{\bm{k}} + \bm{k_0}\hat{\mathbb{I}}  
  \end{split}
\end{align}

We now recognize the two exponentials in Eq.~\eqref{eq:ourL} as being
the real-space representation of $\hat{T}^2(\bm{k_0})$ and its
hermitian conjugate. This motivates us to define the following unitary
operator
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ucal}
  \hat{{\cal T}}(\bm{k_0}) = \mat{\hat{T}(\bm{k_0})}{0}{0}{\hat{T}^{\dagger}(\bm{k_0})}
\end{equation}
% 
such that a unitary transformation of our operator $\Lca$ now restores translational
symmetry. Indeed, one can see that
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:translated-L}
  \hat{{\cal T}} \hat{\Lca} \hat{{\cal T}}^{\dagger} = \mat{\frac{\left(\kop + \bm{k_0}\right)^2}{2m} - \frac{k_0^2}{2m} + g\rho_0}{g N_0 \psi_0^2}{- g N_0 \psi_0^{\star 2}}{-\left[\frac{\left(\kop - \bm{k_0}\right)^2}{2m} - \frac{k_0^2}{2m} + g\rho_0 \right]}
\end{equation}
% 
where we have make use of Eqs.~\eqref{eq:products} and we have written
$\hat{\Lca}$ in a base-independent representation.  In the subspace of
momentum eigenstates $\ket{\kv}$, we can write the (right-)eigenvalue
equation corresponding to Eq.~\eqref{eq:translated-L} as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:right-eigen}
  \Lca_{\text{GP}} [k] \colvec{U_\sigma(k)}{V_\sigma(k)} = \epsilon_\sigma(k) \colvec{U_\sigma(k)}{V_\sigma(k)}
\end{equation}
% 
where we have recovered the matrix representation of
Eq.~\eqref{eq:LGP}, and introduced the notation
$\omega_\sigma(\kv) = \bm{v}_0 \kv + \epsilon_\sigma(k)$. Here
$\sigma = \pm$ labels the 2 different eigenmodes and we defined
$\bm{v}_0 \equiv \frac{\kv_0}{m}$ as the speed of the condensate.

Notice that the $k=0$ mode has only one eigenvector. However, one can
safely exclude it as this mode does not imply energy or momentum
transport. Excluding the $k = 0$ point, one can then solve
Eq.~\eqref{eq:right-eigen} and obtain the celebrated Bogoliubov
excitation spectrum
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bogoliubov}
  \epsilon_\sigma(k) = \sigma \left[\frac{k^2}{2m}\left(\frac{k^2}{2m} + 2 g \rho_0 \right) \right]^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
% 
with $\sigma = \pm$. Notice that the complex amplitudes $U_\sigma(k)$,
$V_\sigma(k)$ only depend on the absolute value of $\kv$, while the
(real) spectrum of Eq.~\eqref{eq:translated-L}, $\omega_\sigma(\kv)$
is the Bogoliubov spectrum with an additional Galilean boost
$\bm{v}_0 \kv$.

As can be seen from Eq.~\eqref{eq:symmetry-2}, the 2 eigen-families
$\sigma$ and $-\sigma$ are linked by a duality, stemming from the
$\cal{P} \cal{T}$ symmetry\footnote{This can be actually formally
  proven after defining the parity and time-reversal operators
  corresponding to our problem. For details, see
  Ref.~\cite{MOSTAFAZADEH_2010}.} of the Bogoliubov operator $\Lca$.
We therefore drop the subscript and make the convention that
$\left( U,\, V \right) \equiv \left( U_{+},\, V_{+}
\right)$. Furthermore, making use of Eq.~\eqref{eq:symmetry-1}, we can
act with $\sigma_3$ on the eigenstates of $\Lca_{\text{GP}}$ to obtain
the ones of $\Lca_{\text{GP}}^{\dagger}$. 

This finally leads us to a biorthonormal basis
$\left\{ \ket{\psi_\sigma^R(\kv)},\, \ket{\psi_\sigma^L(\kv)} \right\}$
with 4 basis vectors
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:biorthobasis}
  \left\{ \colvec{U(k)}{V(k)}, \colvec{V^{\star}(k)}{U^{\star}(k)}, \colvec{U(k)}{-V(k)}, \colvec{-V^{\star}(k)}{U^{\star}(k)} \right\} \bigotimes \ket{\kv}
\end{equation}
% 
which fulfills the orthonormality condition
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:binormality}
  \braket{\psi_{\sigma^{\prime}}^L(\kv^{\prime})}{\psi_\sigma^R(\kv)} = \delta_{\sigma,\sigma^{\prime}} \delta^2(\kv - \kv^{\prime})
\end{equation}
% 
provided of course that we normalize in such a way that
$\abs{U(k)}^2 - \abs{V(k)}^2 = 1$, and the completeness relation
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bicompleteness}
  \sum_{\sigma = \pm} \int d^2 \kv \; \ket{\psi_\sigma^R(\kv)}\bra{\psi_\sigma^L(\kv)} = 1
\end{equation}
% 
In this basis, the spectral decomposition of
Eq.~\eqref{eq:translated-L} is of the diagonal form
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bidecomposition}
  \hat{{\cal T}} \hat{\Lca} \hat{{\cal T}}^{\dagger} = \sum_{\sigma = \pm} \int d^2 \kv \; \omega_\sigma(\kv) \ket{\psi_\sigma^R(\kv)}\bra{\psi_\sigma^L(\kv)}
\end{equation}
% 
The concrete form of $\Lca_{\text{GP}}[k]$, coupled with the
normalization condition Eq.~\eqref{eq:norms}, determines the
eigenvectors of the ``+'' family up to a phase factor. Indeed, one can
choose $\abs{U(k)} \pm \abs{V(k)} = f(k)^{\pm\frac{1}{4}}$, with 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:norms}
  f(k) = \frac{\frac{k^2}{2m}}{\frac{k^2}{2m} + 2g\rho_0}
\end{equation}
% 
It is now a trivial matter to solve the linearized evolution equation
Eq.~\eqref{eq:GP-atoms-system} for our problem. In particular, for a
localized static defect potential $V_d(\rv) = g_V \delta^2(\rv)$,

\section{Microcavity exciton-polaritons}
\label{sec:polaritons}


\subsection{Model system}
\label{subsec:model}



Consider the following (simplified) physical system. We have an
optical cavity containing photons confined along the growth direction
$z$ by its metalic mirrors. At position $z_{\text{QW}}$, the cavity
contains a 2D quantum well (QW), which is a thin semiconductor layer
sandwitched in between another alloy acting as a barrier. The setup is
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cavity-polaritons} (for an in-depth
introduction to the physics of semiconductor microcavities, see
Ref.~\cite{9780199228942}). The photons create electron-hole
hydrogenlike bound pairs (excitons) confined by the barrier inside the
QW. Exactly describing the system of electrons, holes and photons,
taking into account their Coulomb interaction and the disorder created
by defects inside the QW, as well as imperfections present in the
cavity mirrors is a daunting task that would also not provide much
physical insight into this system. We therefore use a series of
approximations and construct an effective Hamiltonian description that
is more physically transparent.
%
\begin{figure}[tb]\centering

    From Ref.~\cite{Kasprzak_2006}.
    % 
  }\label{fig:cavity-polaritons}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Microscopic description}
\label{subsec:microscopic}


We start by writing down the kinetic energy of the photons
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cavity-energy}
  H_{C} = \sum_{\kv} \omega_C(k) a_{\kv}^{\dagger} a_{\kv}
\end{equation}
% 
where we've made use of the translational symmetry of the problem in
the $(x,y)$ plane and labeled the bosonic creation (annihilation)
operators $a_{\kv}^{\dagger}$ ($a_{\kv}$) by the in-plane momentum
$\kv$. These operators satisfy the standard commutation relations
\begin{align}
  \left[a_{\kv}, a_{\kv^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\right] & =\delta_{\kv,\kv^{\prime}}\\
  \left[a_{\kv}, a_{\kv^{\prime}}\right] & =\left[a_{\kv}^{\dagger}, a_{\kv^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\right] = 0
\end{align}

The confinement along the $z$ direction leads to the quantization of
the photon momentum $k_z = 2 \pi N/l_z$, with $N = 1,2,\dots$
indexing the longitudinal modes ($N=5$ in
Fig.~\ref{fig:cavity-polaritons}) and $l_z$ being the cavity width,
i.e. the distance between the
mirrors. Fig.~\ref{fig:cavity-polaritons} depicts the photonic field
as a standing wave, which is the measurable electric field inside the
cavity. This field can be expressed in terms of photonic operators by
$E(\kv,z)a_{\kv} +$ H.c., where the photon mode wavefunction
$E(\kv,z)$ has the sinusoidal shape~\cite{Carusotto_2013}
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:electric-field}
  E(\kv,z) \propto \sqrt{\omega_C(k)/l_z} \sin \left(k_z z\right)
\end{equation}
% 


The cavity photon dispersion for each of these modes is therefore
$\omega_C(k) = v \sqrt{k^2 + k_z^2}$, with $v$ the speed of light in
the semiconductor. Expanding the square root for $k \ll k_z$, one has
$\omega_C(k) \approx \omega_C(0) + k^2/(2m_{C})$. We see that
cavity photons, as opposed to free-space photons, have a quadratic
dispersion with an effective mass related to the cutoff frequency
$\omega_C(0)$ by $m_{C} v^2 = \omega_C(0)$. For typical cavities used
in experiments, $m_{C}$ is of the order of $10^{-5}$ (free) electron
masses $m_e^0$ (see Tab.~\ref{tab:GaAs-params}).

We now turn our attention to the semiconductor QW. For simplicity,
consider a spin-polarized direct bandgap semiconductor such as GaAs,
so that we can neglect additional spin degrees of freedom. We further
assume that the dispersions of single particle states in the
conduction and valence bands have the quadratic form
$\varepsilon^c_{k} = \varepsilon_g/2 + k^2/(2m_e)$ and
$\varepsilon^v_{k} = - \varepsilon_g/2 - k^2/(2m_h)$, with
$\varepsilon_g$ the semiconductor bandgap and $m_e$ and $m_h$ the
effective masses for electrons and (heavy) holes. Excitons have a
typical extension $\lambda_X = \frac{\epsilon}{2\mu e^2}$ called the
(2D) exciton Bohr radius, with $\epsilon$ the static dielectric
constant, $e$ the electron charge and $\mu^{-1} = m_e^{-1} + m_h^{-1}$
their reduced mass. Their binding energy is called the exciton
Rydberg, defined as $\Ry_X = \frac{e^2}{\epsilon \lambda_X}$.

We define $c_{\kv}^{\dagger}$ and $v_{\kv}$ as the operators which
create an electron in the empty conduction band, respectively a hole
in the filled valence band, and which obey the Fermi anticommutation
rules
\begin{align}
  \left\{c_{\kv}, c_{\kv^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\right\} & =\delta_{\kv,\kv^{\prime}}\\
  \left\{c_{\kv}, c_{\kv^{\prime}}\right\} & = \left\{c_{\kv}^{\dagger}, c_{\kv^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\right\} = 0
\end{align}
and similar for $v_{\kv}$. We can therefore write the electronic
Hamiltonian in terms of these new operators as~\cite{Keeling_2007}
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:coulomb-hamiltonian}
  H_{\text{el}} = \sum_{\kv} \left( \varepsilon^c_k c_{\kv}^{\dagger} c_{\kv} + \varepsilon^v_k v_{\kv}^{\dagger} v_{\kv} \right) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\bm{q}} V_q \left( \rho^e_{\bm{q}} \rho^e_{-\bm{q}} + \rho^h_{\bm{q}} \rho^h_{-\bm{q}} -2 \rho^e_{\bm{q}} \rho^h_{-\bm{q}}\right)
\end{equation}
% 
Here we have introduced the electron and hole densities,
$\rho^e_{\bm{q}} = \sum_{\kv} c_{\kv + \bm{q}}^{\dagger} c_{\kv}$ and
$\rho^h_{\bm{q}} = \sum_{\kv} v_{\kv} v_{\kv + \bm{q}}^{\dagger}$. The
matrix element of the Coulomb potential
$V_q = \frac{e^2}{2 \epsilon A q}$ depends on cavity quantization area
$A$, but this dependence drops out when passing from discrete sums
over states to intragrals over $\kv$.

Finally, the last ingredient of our microscopic description concerns
the interaction between electrons and photons. Making use of the
dipole approximation, we have
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dipolar-inter}
  H_{\text{dipole}} = \sum_{\kv, \bm{q}} G(q) \left( a_{\bm{q}}^{\dagger} v_{\kv + \bm{q}}^{\dagger} c_{\kv} + \text{H.c.}\right)
\end{equation}
% 
with the strength
$G(q) = e \mu_{\text{cv}}\sqrt{\frac{\omega_C(q)}{2\epsilon A l_z}}$
written in the dipole gauge, where $\mu_{\text{cv}}$ is the inter-band
dipole matrix element.


\subsection{Effective Hamiltonian}
\label{subsec:effective}


We are interested in an approximate description of the problem where
we can consider the excitons as fundamental quasiparticle excitations
from the ground state of the semiconductor and treat the Coulomb term
in Eq.~\eqref{eq:coulomb-hamiltonian} as an effective exciton-exciton
interaction. We then couple the resulting excitons to light, and
obtain the so-called \textbf{weakly interacting boson model} for
polaritons. The name stems from the fact that, at moderate
electron-hole densities, such that the inter-exciton distance is much
larger than $\lambda_X$, one can assume excitons to behave esentially
as (composite) bosons~\cite{deveaud2003electron}, and therefore
describe them using the Bose creation and annihilation operators
$b_{\kv}^{\dagger}$ and $b_{\kv}$. Making an Usui
transformation~\cite{Usui1960} and truncating the interaction terms at
fourth order results in the following three-part effective
Hamiltonian~\cite{Ciuti_2003}
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:total-ham}
  H_{\text{eff}} = H_0  + H_{\text{XX}} + H_{XC}^{\text{sat}}
\end{equation}
% 
where we have defined
\begin{align}
  H_0 & =\sum_{\kv}\left(a_{\kv}^{\dagger},\, b_{\kv}^{\dagger}\right)\mat{\omega_C(k)}{\Omega_R}{\Omega_R}{\omega_X(k)}\colvec{a_{\kv}}{b_{\kv}}\label{eq:polariton-ham}\\
  H_{\text{XX}} & =\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\kv,\kv^{\prime},\bm{q}}U_{\kv - \kv^{\prime},\bm{q}}b_{\kv + \bm{q}}^{\dagger}b_{\kv^{\prime} - \bm{q}}^{\dagger}b_{\kv^{\prime}}b_{\kv}\label{eq:interaction-ham}\\
  H_{XC}^{\text{sat}} & =-\frac{\Omega_R}{\rho_{\text{sat}}A}\sum_{\kv,\kv^{\prime},\bm{q}}\left(b_{\kv^{\prime}-\bm{q}}^{\dagger}b_{\kv + \bm{q}}^{\dagger}b_{\kv}a_{\kv^{\prime}} + \text{H.c.}\right)\label{eq:saturation-ham}
\end{align}
$H_0$ contains the kinetic energy of the excitons and cavity photons,
as well as their harmonic coupling, ie. the conversion of an exciton
to a cavity photon at the Rabi frequency $\Omega_R$, which depends on
the overlap between the wavefunctions of the exciton and photon
through the  oscillator strength surface density $f_{\text{2D}}$ of
the excitonic transition
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:omega-R}
  \Omega_R \propto \sqrt{\omega_C(0)l_z^{-1}f_{\text{2D}}} \frac{E(z_{\text{QW}})}{E_{\text{max}}}
\end{equation}
% 
where $E_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum amplitude of the cavity photon
electric field, at one of its antinodes from
Eq.~\eqref{eq:electric-field}. It is worth noting that both
Eq.~\eqref{eq:dipolar-inter} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:polariton-ham} make use
of the rotating-wave approximation, neglecting antiresonant terms
which do not conserve the number of excitations, such as
$b_{\kv}a_{\kv}$ and $b_{\kv}^{\dagger}a_{\kv}^{\dagger}$. This is
justified so long as $\Omega_R \ll \omega_C(0),\, \omega_X(0)$, which
is normally the case, as can be seen by inspecting
Tab.~\ref{tab:GaAs-params}.

Eq.~\eqref{eq:polariton-ham} can be diagonalized by means of a unitary
transformation of the form~\cite{Hopfield1958}
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hopfield-trans}
  \colvec{p_{\kv}}{u_{\kv}} = \mat{X_k}{C_k}{-C_k}{X_k} \colvec{b_{\kv}}{a_{\kv}}
\end{equation}
% 
The normal modes of $H_0$ are called \textbf{upper and lower
  polaritons} (UP and LP) and correspond to the Bose operators
$u_{\kv}$ and $p_{\kv}$, with eigenenergies
%
\begin{figure}[tb]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{polariton_dispersion}
  \caption{

The exciton and cavity photon dispersions are depicted with dashed (red) lines. Due to their light mass, the polaritons have a very sharp dispersion  compared to excitons. Also note the typical anticrossing form characteristic of strong light-matter coupling.

    % 
}\label{fig:polariton-dispersion}
\end{figure}
% 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:polariton-dispersion}
  \omega_{\text{UP,LP}}(k) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\omega_C(k) + \omega_X(k)\right) \pm \frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\omega_C(k) - \omega_X(k)\right)^2 + 4 \Omega_R^2\right]^{1/2}
\end{equation}
% 
where the $\pm$ signs refer to the UP and LP branches and the Hopfield
coefficients appearing in Eq.~\eqref{eq:hopfield-trans} are
\begin{align}
  X_k & =\left[1 + \left(\frac{\Omega_R}{\omega_{\text{LP}}(k) - \omega_C(k)}\right)^2\right]^{-1/2}\label{eq:hopfield-X}\\
  C_k & =-\left[1 + \left(\frac{\omega_{\text{LP}}(k) - \omega_C(k)}{\Omega_R}\right)^2\right]^{-1/2}
\end{align}
The two branches of the polaritonic dispersion relation are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:polariton-dispersion}, together with the dispersions of
the cavity photons and excitons. One can therefore think of polaritons
as being massive photons dressed by matter excitations.

Note that the 1s-exciton energy can be approximated as
$\omega_X(k) = \omega_X(0) + \frac{k^2}{2M}$, with the exciton mass
$M = m_e + m_h$ of the order of the electron mass and
$\omega_X(0) = \varepsilon_g - \Ry_X$. Since, as we have already
noted, $M$ is several orders of magnitude larger than the cavity
photon mass $m_{C}$, one can in practice neglect the momentum
dependence of the excitonic dispersion and consider it to be
flat. Furthermore, we can agree to measure energies starting from
$\omega_X(0)$ and denote the detuning between exciton and photon bands
as $\delta \equiv \omega_C(0) - \omega_X(0)$. For zero detuning
($\delta = 0$), the splitting between the two polariton branches is
$2\Omega_R$. In order to tune $\delta$ in experiments, one tipically
builds the cavity mirrors with a wedge~\cite{Weisbuch1992}.



$H_{\text{XX}}$ quantifies the effective repulsive exciton-exciton
interaction, with a momentum dependent strength
$U_{\kv - \kv^{\prime},\bm{q}}$ that can be calculated from the
Coulomb exchange term in the Born approximation.  Notice that the
form of this interaction corresponds to Feynman diagrams with
4-legged vertices in quantum field theory language, implying binary
collision with momentum conservation: two excitons in the planewave
states $\ket{\kv}$ and $\ket{\kv^{\prime}}$ scatter into the new
states $\ket{\bm{\kv+\bm{q}}}$ and $\ket{\bm{\kv^{\prime}-\bm{q}}}$.
A further approximation that one can make for wave vectors much
smaller than $\lambda_X^{-1}$ is to reduce
$U_{\kv - \kv^{\prime},\bm{q}}$ to a contact potential
$g_X \equiv \frac{1}{2} U_{\bm{0},\bm{0}} =
\frac{6e^2\lambda_X}{2A\epsilon}$, as shown in
Ref.~\cite{Ciuti1998}. As a result, $g_X$ physically represents the
interaction between two excitons in the same single-particle momentum
eigenstate $\ket{\kv}$.

Finally, the last term of Eq.~\eqref{eq:total-ham},
$H_{\text{XC}}^{\text{sat}}$, can be interpreted as a saturation
effect due to the Pauli exclusion principle underlying the fermionic
character of the excitons~\cite{Tassone1999}. The exciton saturation
density $\rho_{\text{sat}} \sim \frac{7}{16\pi\lambda_X^2}$ generally
depends on the specific shape of the internal wavefunction of the
exciton~\cite{Glazov2009}.  For the problems we will be treating in
the remainder of this manuscript it can be considered large enough to
justify neglecting this anharmonic contribution to the total
Hamiltonian Eq.~\eqref{eq:total-ham} (see Tab.~\ref{tab:GaAs-params}).

Before concluding this Section, one should mention the validity
limitations of the weakly interacting boson model for polaritons
reviewed here. Its derivation, by means of the Usui transformation,
implies an expansion of the original fermionic operators of
Eq.~\eqref{eq:coulomb-hamiltonian} in powers of bosonic operators,
having as small parameter the number of excitons per Bohr radius
$\lambda_X$. Truncating this series at fourth order results in an
upper bound on the exciton density of around $1/\lambda_X^2$. At
higher densities, an electron-hole plasma-like state is formed, with a
a qualitatively different behaviour~\cite{COMBESCOT2008}.  We see that
this model is particularly useful for the case when the dominant
interaction is the Coulomb repulsion between the excitons.

\subsection{Lower polaritons}
\label{subsec:lower-polaritons}

%TODO: LP branch well approximated by parabolic dispersion with
% effective mass $m_{\text{LP}}$ and cutoff freq $\omega_{\text{LP}}(0)$

For temperatures much smaller than the Rabi splitting between the two
polariton branches, we can neglect the upper polaritons and project
Eq.~\eqref{eq:total-ham} on the basis of lower-polariton states
only. Employing the approximations discussed above, we obtain the
lower-polariton Hamiltonian
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:LP-ham}
  H_{\text{LP}} = \sum_{\kv} \omega_{\text{LP}}(k) p_{\kv}^{\dagger} p_{\kv} + \sum_{\kv,\kv^{\prime},\bm{q}} V^{\text{eff}}_{\kv,\kv^{\prime},\bm{q}}\, p^{\dagger}_{\kv + \bm{q}} p^{\dagger}_{\kv^{\prime} - \bm{q}} p_{\kv} p_{\kv^{\prime}}
\end{equation}
% 
where the strength of the repulsive interaction between lower
polaritons now depends on in-plane momentum through the Hopfield
coefficients\footnote{The interaction strength $g_X$ can usually be
  rescaled to 1 by a simple transformation.}
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:g-eff}
  V^{\text{eff}}_{\kv,\kv^{\prime},\bm{q}} = g_X X_{\kv + \bm{q}}X_{\kv^{\prime} - \bm{q}}X_{\kv}X_{\kv^{\prime}}
\end{equation}
% 
This effective interaction, originating from the binary Coulomb
scattering of the excitons, is the one responsible for the collective
behaviour of the polaritons, and in particular superfluid
hydrodynamics, an aspect which we will explore in the next two chapters.

Physically, the quantities $\abs{X_k}^2$ and $\abs{C_k}^2$ are the
excitonic and photonic fractions of the lower lower polariton
mode. Their momentum dependence is not very pronounced, as for
$\delta = 0$, $X_k$ is between $1/\sqrt{2}$ and $1$ and if we are also
at normal incidence, meaning $\kv = 0$, than the light and matter
content of lower polaritons are each equal to $1/2$.

\subsection{Disorder effects}
\label{subsec:disorder}


It is noteworthy to remark that Hamiltonian Eq.~\eqref{eq:total-ham}
does not include any disorder. We have already mentioned that there
are two distinct disorder classes in this problem. One is the
excitonic disorder, acting on length scales of around 10 nanometers,
which tipically affects the exciton oscillator strengths
$f_{\text{2D}}$, but not the spatial polaritonic density. This type of
disorder stems from variations in the QW thickness as well as alloy
imperfections and is typically not strong enough to dissociate
excitons. Neglecting excitonic disorder also implies that each
localized exciton state couples to precisely one extended photon
state. The resulting polaritons are then nothing but the coherent
superposition of these excitonic and photonic states.

Photonic disorder, on the other hand, acts on lengthscales
$\ell_{C} = (m_{C}\Omega_R)^{-1/2}$ on the order of microns (see
Tab.~\ref{tab:GaAs-params}) and therefore can disrupt the polariton
density profile. It is normally caused by the presence of
imperfections inherent to the growth process of the cavity
mirrors. These defects can act as scattering centers for the
polaritons, and can be included in the Hamiltonian as an additional
external scalar potential. We will see some eloquent examples of
polariton scattering in the following chapters.

%TODO: add defect potential

\subsection{Pumping and dissipation}
\label{subsec:pumping}

Also note that the spectrum in Fig.~\ref{fig:polariton-dispersion} is
represented as a function of the angle $\theta$ of emission of a
photon out of the cavity, as depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:cavity-polaritons}. Conservation of in-plane momentum
and photon frequency dictates that a laser beam coming in at an angle
$\theta$ and frequency $\omega$ resonantly excites a microcavity mode
with wave vector $k_{\parallel} = \frac{\omega}{c}\sin(\theta)$.

Typical decay rates for excitons
($\gamma_X$) and cavity photons ($\gamma_C$) in GaAs-based
microcavities are also shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:GaAs-params}.

%TODO: different types of pumping
%TODO: directly excited by laser and detected via reflection/transmission 

%TODO: near-field (far-field) emission from the cavity gives the real
% (momentum) space photon density

% If one uses a continuous wave laser to replenish
% the lost photons, a steady state can eventually be reached where the
% pumping balances the losses. The system is however in a
% driven-dissipative state, out of thermal equilibrium.

%TODO: strong coupling when Omega_R > losses (\gamma).


\subsection{Realistic systems}
\label{subsec:realistic}

To get a more quantitative idea of the physics involved, it is worth
describing realistic samples typically used in state-of-the-art
experiments. Instead of simple metallic mirrors, such microcavities
are usually bound by a series of up to around 20 distributed Bragg
reflectors (DBRs), which are alternating dielectric layers of
thickness $\lambda/4$ and different refractive indices, achieving a
total reflectivity of over $99.9$\%~\cite{9780199228942}. 

Multiple CdTe or GaAs QWs a few nanometers thick are placed inside the
cavity of length $l_z = 2\lambda \sim 1~\mu$m, at the antinodes
(maxima) of the photonic electric field, in order to maximize the
coupling between excitons and photons (see
Eq.~\eqref{eq:omega-R}). When $N$ QWs are placed in the cavity at the
electric field maxima, the light-matter coupling $\Omega_R$ is
enhanced by a factor $\sqrt{N}$. Furthermore, the cavity cutoff
frequency $\omega_C(0)$ is normally chosen close to the exciton
frequency $\omega_X(0)$.

Typical values of the relevant parameters for GaAs-based
microcavities are shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:GaAs-params}.

\subsection{Mean-field description of condensed state}
\label{subsec:mean-field}

Consider now the low-temperature case, where the polaritons form a
BEC-like condensate in the momentum eigenstate $\ket{\kv}$. In this
case, since we have the macroscopic ocupation of a single particle
state, we can follow the standard Bogoliubov prescription and treat
the operator $p_{\kv}$ as a classical wavefunction, which we will
denote by $\psi_{\kv}$. The time-evolution of this classical object is
a Gross-Pitaevksii-like equation obtained from Heisenberg's equation
of motion
$i \partial_t \psi_{\kv}(t) = \left[\psi_{\kv}(t),\,
  H_{\text{LP}}\right]$.  Since polariton condensates are
intrinsically out-of-equilibrium systems, one also had to add
additional terms in order to describe pumping and losses. We therefore
get a driven-dissipative mean-field equation, neglecting both quantum
and thermal fluctuations of the field $\psi_{\kv}$. In momentum space
this reads
%
\begin{multline}\label{eq:mom-GPE}
  i\partial_t\psi_{\kv} = \left[\omega_{\text{LP}}(k) - \frac{i}{2} \gamma_k\right]\psi_{\kv} + \sum_{\kv_1,\kv_2} g_{\kv,\kv_1,\kv_2} \psi^{\star}_{\kv_1 + \kv_2 - \kv} \psi_{\kv_2} \psi_{\kv_1}\\
  + C_k f_p \exp{\left(-i \omega_pt\right)} \delta_{\kv,\kv_{p}}
